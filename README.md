### Suggested Repository Name: `IMDB-Sentiment-Analysis` --- ### README.md Content: ```markdown # IMDB Sentiment Analysis This project implements a 
sentiment analysis system for IMDB movie reviews. The goal is to classify each review as **positive** or **negative** using machine learning models.
The performance of models like Logistic Regression and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) is evaluated and compared. --- 
## Dataset The dataset contains **50,000 movie reviews** labeled as: - `positive` for positive reviews - `negative` for negative reviews ### Columns:
1. **review**: The text of the movie review. 2. **sentiment**: The sentiment label (`positive` or `negative`). The dataset is divided into **80% training** and **20% testing**.
2.  --- ## Models Used ### 1. Logistic Regression - **F1-Score**: `0.8901` - **Accuracy**: `0.8878` ### 2. Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) - Results are based on a neural network with two hidden layers
3.   trained using the TensorFlow library. --- ## Steps to Reproduce ### 1. Prerequisites - Python 3.8+ - Required libraries: ``` pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, tensorflow,
4.    matplotlib ``` Install dependencies using: ```bash pip install -r requirements.txt ``` ### 2. Running the Code 1. Clone the repository: ```bash
5.git clone https://github.com/your-username/IMDB-Sentiment-Analysis.git cd IMDB-Sentiment-Analysis ``` 2. Place the **IMDB_Dataset.csv** in the
   repository directory. 3. Run the Python script: ```bash python sentiment_analysis.py ``` --- ## Features of the Code 1. **Preprocessing** -
   Converts text to lowercase. - Removes punctuation. - Applies TF-IDF vectorization with 5000 features. 2. **Modeling** - Logistic Regression:
   A simple linear model for classification. - Multi-Layer Perceptron: A neural network with dropout layers to prevent overfitting.
6. **Evaluation Metrics** - **F1-Score**: Balances precision and recall. - **Confusion Matrix**: Visualizes model performance.
7.  **Visualization**
8. f1_score: 0.8901292596944771
Accuracy: 0.8878
